# Five Sicilies

Take a journey through time when you visit these five Sicilian attractions. Medievalists
and Italian culture enthusiasts will enjoy an abundance of architectural masterpieces
that serve as standing icons of Sicily’s Norman past. The Norman period (c. 1061 –
1194) encompasses a culturally rich point in Sicily’s history during which the island
experienced transformative sociopolitical changes. Despite the significant amount of
time that has passed since the Norman period, its influence remains relevant to the
twenty-first-century traveler and scholar.

## 1. Catania

Catania is on the east coast of Sicily and is best known for Mt. Etna, one of the
two active volcanoes in all of Italy. Though the Cathedral of Catania and the
church of Sant’Agata La Vetere might not be the first locations that come to mind
for this region, these Sicilian churches are hidden gems worth exploring.
Catania’s cathedral will draw the attention of anyone in its presence and will be
especially interesting to visitors with a love of Baroque architecture.

## 2. Messina

One of the more recognizable regions in Sicily, Messina is a harbor city that is
closest to mainland Italy. There are many sites in Messina that date to the
Norman period, including Santo Stefano di Messina, Santa Maria delle Scale, the
Cathedral of Messina, the church of the Santissima Annunziata dei Catalani, the
church of San Giacomo and the former monastery of Santa Maria di
Roccamadore. The Messina’s cathedral is one of the best-known monuments in
the region. This church is distinctive for its ornate bell tower with various
sculptural figures and arch detailing, making it a memorable landmark that
reminds visitors of the area’s Norman past.

## 3. Cefalù

The Mediterranean coast is not the only noteworthy part of Cefalù. Located in
northern Sicily, Cefalù is home to a number of sites with origins in the Norman
period. These include Cefalù’s cathedral, the church of San Biagio, the church of
San Giorgio, the Osterio Magno and the Palazzo Maria. Many of these sites offer
a wealth of information that offers visitors a glimpse into Sicily’s medieval history,
including the duomo’s impressive exterior façade. The Byzantine-influenced
mosaics inside are also compelling.

## 4. Lipari

Lipari is an island located off the northern coast of Sicily. The church of San
Bartolomeo di Lipari is a remnant from the island’s Norman past. The church is
distinct for its significant stonework and columns depicting different symbols in
relief sculpture.

## 5. Taormina

Perhaps best known for its ancient theater, there is so much more to explore in
this idyllic comune. Taormina is home to many monuments from the Norman
period including its castle, the church of the Madonna della Rocca, the church of
San Nicolo di Bari and the Palazzo Corvaja. The church of Madonna della Rocca
is worth exploring beyond its surface. Inside the church, there are various
sculptures and artifacts decorating the space that tell about the unique origins of
the area’s history.
