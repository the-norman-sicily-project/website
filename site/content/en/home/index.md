_Detail from Muhammad al-Idrīsī's world map contained in the twelfth-century Kitāb nuzhat al-mushtāq fī ikhtirāq al-āfāq (The Pleasure Excursion of One Who Is Eager to Traverse the Regions of the World), whose title Idrīsī later changed to Kitab Rujar(Book of Roger), which contained what was perhaps the most accurate map of the medieval world. The selection is an illustration of Sicily and Southern Italy. The orientation appears to be upside down because south is located at the top of the map in accordance with the cartographic conventions of the Balkhī school of geography._

## About ##

This project is an effort to document the cultural heritage of Sicily from c. 1061 – 1194, a transformative period in the island's history, by using print, photographic, web and geolocation technologies to identify and explicate dilapidated, at-risk, and/or hard-to-access monuments. The island's castles, monasteries, churches, palaces, bridges, and other monuments are housed in a NoSQL database that provides maximum flexibility of data storage as well as when information is queried and returned. The website, which is very much under construction, is being developed with a close eye toward usability that encourages both scholars and students to interact with the interface and learn more about Sicily's Norman past. Each site has its own discrete page embedded with pertinent information, including photos and display location on a regional map. The geolocation information makes it possible to travel to the site and ultimately there will be versions of the interface available to users of both tablets and mobile phones. This is especially valuable as it is difficult to reach many of these sites as they are often not well signed and at significant elevation. In time, there will be an array of visualizations available to help make sense of the data. These will include density charts for monasteries and fortifications as well as pie charts that offer information about Sicily's religious houses (Latin vs. Greek, monastic order, status, etc.). Key to this site will be several essays. Some will interpret the data we have collected against a wider historical backdrop, providing greater understanding of Norman society. Others will consider the data within a sustainability framework.

One of the most innovative aspects of this site is its focus on sustainability. In addition to treating these monuments as testaments to a vibrant past, this project also approaches them as living organisms - survivors of centuries of climactic trials and tribulations - which are in desperate need of physical examination. Collaboration with [Dr. Greg Pope](http://www.montclair.edu/profilepages/view_profile.php?username=popeg) of MSU's [Department of Earth and Environmental Studies](https://www.montclair.edu/csam/earth-environment-studies/) has enabled us to [assess the integrity of some of these monuments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTZxt60CDUE) and to share this information in the sites' records. A new collaboration with Co-Investigator Casey Allen will build on this foundation.

We are grateful for the financial support this project has received from the Angelo and Mary Cali Fund for Italian Studies,
an award administered by the Dean of the [College of Humanities and Social Sciences](http://www.montclair.edu/chss/), [Montclair State University (MSU)](http://www.montclair.edu/), from the [CHSS Dean's Office](https://www.montclair.edu/chss/about-the-college/deans-office/) itself, from the Herman and Margaret Sokol Faculty/Student Research Grant Program that is administered by MSU's [College of Science and Mathematics (CSAM)](https://www.montclair.edu/csam/pseg-sustainability-institute/) as well as from MSU's [PSE&G Institute for Sustainability Studies](https://www.montclair.edu/csam/pseg-sustainability-institute/). In addition, we are also enormously grateful for the support of the [National Endowment for the Humanities](https://www.neh.gov/), whose logo appears below, for the generous grants it awarded the project for 2019-2021 and 2024-2027 through its [Humanities Collections and Reference Resources](https://www.neh.gov/grants/preservation/humanities-collections-and-reference-resources) program. Please note, however, that any views, findings, conclusions, or recommendations expressed in this web resource do not necessarily represent those of the agency.

## Credits ##

A number of [Montclair State University](http://www.montclair.edu/) students have played critical roles in the development of this site as it got off the ground. Ryan Marshall ([CSAM](https://www.montclair.edu/csam/), 2019) helped develop the interactive map that enables the site's users to engage the data. Isamar Cortes ([CSAM](https://www.montclair.edu/csam/), 2019) was also instrumental; her experience with various GIS packages
to create elevations and maps that allow for the visualization of data
in their geographical contexts has been invaluable. Another important member
of our team, Jamila Haramuniz ([CSAM](https://www.montclair.edu/csam/), 2020), had kindly loaned her prodigious statistical skills as well
as her knowledge of R to the project, making it possible to consider the
data in new ways. In addition, Matthew Parlapiano ([CEHS](https://www.montclair.edu/cehs/), 2019) did a fine job of extracting data from Alexander of Telese's History, performing the tedious work of preparing the text for machine processing. Isamar's, Jamila's and Matthew's contributions will be incorporated into the project's next iteration. During 2019-2021, we were fortunate to have working on the project as media and metadata assistants Christina Giordano ([CHSS](https://www.montclair.edu/chss/) and [CART](https://www.montclair.edu/arts/), 2022), Grace Last ([CHSS](https://www.montclair.edu/chss/), 2021), Alessandra Lentini ([CART](https://www.montclair.edu/arts/), 2021), James Leyva ([CHSS](https://www.montclair.edu/chss/), 2021) and Charlee Reiff ([CART](https://www.montclair.edu/arts/), 2020). Michael Cerbo ([CHSS](https://www.montclair.edu/chss/), 2024) and Jessica Wood ([CHSS](https://www.montclair.edu/chss/), 2025) helped develop data for the churches that existed in the eastern part of the island during the summers of 2023 and 2024, respectively. In addition, [Antonio Mursia](https://wwwuniroma1.academia.edu/AntonioMursia), a graduate student at the [Sapienza University of Rome](https://www.uniroma1.it/en/pagina-strutturale/home), has generously contributed relevant information from his research. We are very grateful to each of them.

Dave Urban, a Cloud Service Operations Specialist at [Adaptly](https://www.adaptly.com/) did the hard work programming, configuring, testing, and troubleshooting the [image server](http://media.normansicily.org/).

Other assistance was generously offered by Max Wilson ([Yale University](http://yale.edu/), 2019), who served as a research assistant during the project's 2019 fieldwork. That same summer, Anastasia Hayes ([Macaulay Honors College](https://macaulay.cuny.edu/), 2017) provided invaluable translation support and participated in data collection as Madeleine Hayes ([Macaulay Honors College](https://macaulay.cuny.edu/), 2018) navigated and managed logistics of travel. We would also like to thank Alessandra Hayes ([Macaulay Honors College](https://macaulay.cuny.edu/), 2023) for her social media and video support.

Alessandra Faranda ([University of Palermo](https://www.unipa.it/), 2023) has skillfully translated the English version of the site and, in doing so, has made it accessible to a wide Italian public.

We are also grateful to Mel Colella, whose fine editing skills greatly improved the opening video.
