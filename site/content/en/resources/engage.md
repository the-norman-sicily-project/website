### Choropleth Map of Norman Sicily's Monastic Orders {class="resource-item"} ###

In economics, a location quotient is used to determine areas where employment in a specific industry may be over or under represented.

In this [example](http://www.normansicily.org/sicilian_monastic_choropleth_map/), the location quotient concept is applied to the number of monastic foundations by order in Norman Sicily.

In the model, the monastic order replaces the concept of industry. For regions, the boundaries of the modern provinces are used for convenience, while the reference area is the whole of Sicily.
